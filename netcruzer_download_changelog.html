Some modifications have been made to the MAL. New Netcruzer specific code is located in the "modtronix"
folder, and project folders.
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Added support for Winbond Flash chips used in Netcruzer boards</li>
    <li>Added secure Firmware upgrade functionality. When firmware is upgraded, new firmware is copied to the
        external Flash chip. On next power up, the firmware of the SBC is updated with this new firmware.</li>
    <li>Added code for upgrading firmware via the Web interface.</li>
    <li>Added bootloader for upgrading firmware via USB application. To do this, jumper must be set to "F" when
        applying power to board.</li>
    <li>Added circular buffer (Serial Ports) code, can be used for sending and receiving serial data to/from serial
        peripherals of the SBC. Lots of future code will use this function</li>
    <li>Added secure mechanizm for storing and updating application configuration data in the extern EEPROM.
        A duplicate copy is made of all data modified, ensuring that a power fail during modifications will
        not cause configuration data to get currupted.</li>
    <li>Modified HTTP and other code to support webpage uploading via the wget utility</li>
