The Netcruzer USB Terminal application is used to communicate with the SBC board via it's USB port.
It is mainly used for displaying and sending debug information from and to the target board. It can
also be used for sending and receiving commands. Or, the source code can be modified to create a
custom application for communicating with a target board via it's USB port.
