/** @defgroup proj_webserver_wdt Watchdog Timer

The @ref sbc66_sbc66ec and @ref sbc66_sbc66ecl have the watchdog timer configured for 8 seconds (32 second on older hardware) by default.
This means that the watchdog timer has to be cleared (using ClrWdt() command) at least every 8 seconds, or else a system reset will
occur. This is done by the system in the nz_netcruzer.c file. Various flags are set in different places in code, and a check is done in 
nz_netcruzer.c to see if all these flags are getting set. If not, the watchdog timer is not cleared, and the system is reset.

To add custom checks to the watchdog timer logic, the following define can be added to the projdefs.h file:
@code
#define     NZSYS_WDT_CHECK_MAIN_FLAG           ( 1 )
@endcode

When defined, it is required that the "nzGlobals.wdtFlags.bits.main" flag be set every 8 seconds to prevent a system reset:
@code
nzGlobals.wdtFlags.bits.mainApp = 1;
@endcode
