@section proj_webserver_page_configuration_introduction Introduction
Configuration is divided into two sections.
<ul>
<li>Configuring the application during compilation. This consists of options and defines that 
are set in the source code, and will determine the firmware that is created. This
configuration can only be done at compilation, and not at run time when the application is running.
<li>Configuring the application during runtime. These settings are changed via the web based
configuration pages at run time.
</li>
</ul>

@section proj_webserver_page_configuration_application Application Configuration
The application configuration is stored in the PIC microcontroller's internal
EEPROM in the first 256 bytes of data.
For details, see the @ref proj_webserver_appconf "Application Configuration" module of this document.

@section proj_webserver_page_configuration_project Project Configuration
The project configuration is done in the projdefs.h file. It contains a list of defines
that configure the project at compilation.
