/** @defgroup proj_webserver_usb USB
@ingroup proj_webserver_hardware

The <i>@appname</i> has a USB port, implemented as a USB HID (Human Interface Device) Class device. All popular current operating systems
include drivers for USB HID devices. This means no drivers have to be installed, the board is simply plugged into the host computer, and will work.
The USB stack from the @ref devtools_mal is used.
Currently the USB port is used for the following:
- For @ref info_update_usb "Updating Firmware" via the USB Bootloader. The code for this is implemented by the @ref info_proj_usbboot "USB Bootloader" project.
- For debugging and communicating with the firmware via the @ref devtools_nzUsbTerminal. This code is implemented by this project.
